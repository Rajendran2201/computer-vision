# Computer Vision 

The goal of this repository is deep conceptual understanding, clean experimentation, and reproducibility of computer vision tasks. Each module is designed to progress logically from theory to practice, mirroring how computer vision is approached in academic research and industry applications.

### Objectives

- Build strong fundamentals in computer vision and image processing
- Develop intuition behind algorithms, not just code-level familiarity
- Implement techniques using industry-standard libraries
- Maintain a well-documented, revisitable knowledge base
- Create a portfolio-grade repository suitable for interviews and reviews
